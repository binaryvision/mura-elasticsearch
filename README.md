# Mura Elasticsearch

Based on http://github.com/oscarduignan/mura-plugin-elasticsearch which was developed for MuraCon EU 2014

## How to install

Download the latest release and upload the zip as a plugin to your Mura installation.

## How to contribute

Once you've installed the plugin you can replace the plugin directory with a checkout of the source code from github.

The git workflow we're using is Github Flow - read more about it at https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html.

### Tests

We're using testbox v2.0.0 or later as our testing framework, if you want to run tests then you'll need to make sure that /testbox exists. I would recommend just dropping it in your local webroot, download instructions at http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/TestBox.cfm#Download.

See existing tests for examples of how to structure your own.

## Roadmap
